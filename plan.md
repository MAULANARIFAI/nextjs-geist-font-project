Below is the detailed implementation plan for “Maulana Rifai Trending 01” complete with file-by-file outlines, error handling best practices, and UI/UX details.

---

## 1. Overview & Architecture

- The application is a modern trading dashboard with secure authentication, real-time trading signals, multi-layer AI analysis, live chat between AI and the user, and integrations with both TradingView (market data) and MetaTrader 5 (trade execution).  
- The frontend is built with Next.js (React/TypeScript) using the shadcn/ui component style and Tailwind CSS.  
- The backend API endpoints are implemented inside the Next.js app (using the new app directory API routes) to simulate or later integrate with external services.  
- AI layers are designed as separate endpoints which can call an LLM provider (defaulting to OpenRouter with model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4) for processing.

## 3. Step-by-Step Implementation Outline

### Authentication & Security

1. **Login & Register Pages**  
   - In `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`:  
     - Build a modern form with inputs for email/username and password.  
     - Implement client-side validations (e.g., required fields, valid email formats) using regular expressions.  
     - Display error messages using a styled UI dialog (using existing UI components without extra icon libraries).  
   - In `src/app/auth/register/page.tsx`:  
     - Create a registration form with fields for full name, email, phone, and password.  
     - Integrate OTP/email verification placeholders and Google reCAPTCHA if needed.
  
2. **Backend Auth Endpoints**  
   - In `src/app/api/auth/login.ts`:  
     - Parse POST request data, validate credentials, check password (bcrypt compare), and return a JWT token on success.  
     - Use try-catch for error handling and return proper HTTP status codes (e.g., 401 for unauthorized access).  
   - In `src/app/api/auth/register.ts`:  
     - Parse registration data, validate email/phone formats, hash the password using bcrypt, and store in the database (for now, simulate using an in-memory object or demo DB).  
     - Send back status with OTP verification instructions (placeholder implementation).

### Dashboard & Trading Log

3. **Dashboard UI (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)**  
   - Design a header with the application title “Maulana Rifai Trending 01.”  
   - Build a sidebar navigation with items: Dashboard, AI Room, Trading Log, Profile.  
   - In the main panel, create cards (using `src/components/ui/card.tsx`) to display key metrics: daily Profit/Loss, number of signals, success ratios.  
   - Use modern typography, spacing, and color palettes to simulate a premium crypto-trading dashboard.

4. **Trading Log Page (`src/app/trading-log/page.tsx`)**  
   - Build a table (leveraging components from `src/components/ui/table.tsx`) displaying historical trade details such as entry/exit price, profit, loss, and timestamps.  
   - Add buttons to export data to Excel or PDF (simulate the export functionality on click, and later integrate with a server-side library).

### AI Layer Integration & Chat

5. **AI Endpoints**  
   - **Technical Analysis – AI 1 (`src/app/api/ai/technical.ts`):**  
     - Implement logic to read simulated TradingView signal data and “run” analysis for 10 indicators.  
     - Return a JSON with signal validity (BUY/SELL) if conditions are met.
   - **Signal Validator – AI 2 (`src/app/api/ai/validator.ts`):**  
     - Accept output from AI 1, simulate cross-checking with discussion logic, and add further validations.  
     - Proceed only if the result is favorable.
   - **Strategy Executor – AI 3 (`src/app/api/ai/executor.ts`):**  
     - Calculate Stop Loss, Take Profit, and pip values, then simulate sending an execution command to the MT5 endpoint.  
     - Log outcomes including profit/loss and strategy details.
   - **Assistant & News Analyzer – AI 4 (`src/app/api/ai/assistant.ts`):**  
     - Implement endpoints to fetch news from provided URLs (simulate with demo data), perform sentiment analysis (with an LLM call), and return insights.  
     - Integrate chat responses that mimic a conversation with the AI.

6. **Live Chat Interface (AI Room)**  
   - In `src/app/ai-room/page.tsx`:  
     - Design a chat interface with a message list and an input form at the bottom.  
     - Utilize the `ChatBox` component (created in `src/components/chat/ChatBox.tsx`) for rendering conversation threads.  
     - Ensure the design relies on typography, clear spacing, and a minimal color palette for a professional appearance.
   - In `src/components/chat/ChatBox.tsx`:  
     - Build chat bubbles that distinguish between AI and user messages with different background shades and text colors.  
     - Implement error states in case messages fail to deliver, using alert components from the ui folder.

### External Integrations

7. **TradingView and MetaTrader 5 Endpoints**  
   - **TradingView Webhook (`src/app/api/tradingview/webhook.ts`):**  
     - Parse incoming POST requests representing market signals. Validate required fields and forward the data to AI 1 for processing.  
     - Respond with HTTP 200 or proper error responses.
   - **MT5 Execution (`src/app/api/mt5/execute.ts`):**  
     - Simulate a call to the MetaTrader 5 API for trade execution; later, real integration can use the Python MetaTrader 5 API.  
     - Ensure the endpoint returns execution status and error details if the trade fails.

8. **Integration with LLM Provider**  
   - Create a helper module `src/lib/aiService.ts` which:  
     - Contains functions to call the OpenRouter endpoint (`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`) using a POST request and the chosen model (default: “anthropic/claude-sonnet-4”).  
     - Formats the request as an array of role/content objects (for text input or multimodal messages).  
     - Handles error responses and timeouts gracefully, logging errors and notifying the UI of failures.
   - In the AI endpoints (especially AI 4 and the live chat), integrate `aiService.ts` so that any required AI completions are retrieved dynamically.

### Utility Enhancements & Error Handling

9. **Update Utility Helpers (`src/lib/utils.ts`):**  
   - Add functions for standardized API calls (with fetch and error handling wrappers).  
   - Create helper methods for date formatting, logging errors, and retry logic for async API integrations.
   
10. **Global Error Handling & Security**  
    - Wrap API endpoint logic in try-catch blocks, returning meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages.  
    - Use JWT tokens in protected routes; create a middleware (or function in each endpoint) to verify JWTs.  
    - Ensure all sensitive operations (login, registration) perform data sanitation and validation.

11. **Documentation & Environment Configuration**  
    - Update `README.md` with detailed instructions on obtaining the OpenAI API key (e.g., “Buka situs OpenAI, daftarkan akun, dan dapatkan API key dari dashboard” – Indonesian style as per context).  
    - List other necessary credentials (TradingView, MT5) and instructions for configuring local environment variables.  
    - Provide sample curl commands for testing API endpoints, especially for asynchronous tasks (as described in the API testing section).

## 4. UI/UX Considerations

- **Modern Design:**  
  - Use clean typography and a balanced color scheme (light/dark themes) throughout the dashboard.  
  - Use ample white space, clear form fields, and responsive layouts to improve usability on all devices.
  
- **Error/Loading States:**  
  - Each API call in the UI should show a loading spinner (or similar text-based indicator) and clear error messages.  
  - Forms should use inline validations with styled feedback components.

- **Chat Interface:**  
  - Ensure that the chat window auto-scrolls on new messages and differentiates user vs. AI messages with color and alignment differences.
